## 🎯 Goal

To help first-time contributors learn how to use Git & GitHub by making their first pull request in a safe, beginner-friendly environment.

## 🌍 What is Open Source?

Open Source is all about making software accessible to everyone — where the source code is open for anyone to **view**, **use**, **modify**, and **contribute** to. It's the heartbeat of developer communities across the world 💖

If you've ever thought:  
> _"How do I make my first contribution?"_  
> _"What’s a PR?"_  
> _"What if I break something?"_  

Don’t worry. That’s exactly what this lab is for 💪
